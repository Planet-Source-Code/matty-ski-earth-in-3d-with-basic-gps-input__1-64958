### Description

This views the a rotatable earth, if you connect a GPS it will show you the rough position on the globe with a pink square, but when you get on the other side of the planet the accurancy goes down by a dozen miles :( . You can load in a CSV file to inform you if your near a Long/Lat point..... It can record your movents and saves it in another csv file, so you view it on another program attached. I was planning to view the satellites it locks onto and make the earth more detailed when you zoom in on particular points. If I do - I'll upload it another time. This is a bit like a google earth clone.
